In order to reproduce the table from the paper, you will 
- Data 
	- If you have EUROfusion/JET credentials, please contact the authors for location of the jet pedestal database on Heimdall. 
	- Save this to `data/` which is one level above `src/`
- Instal dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- run searches for all models and all input spaces (**TBD**)
    - `chmod +x ./search_all_spaces.sh`
    - `./search_all_spaces.sh`
    - This produces a `.csv` for each model and input space combination in the `results` directory. 
- testing models 
	- Using the optimal parameters from the above search, set the base configuration for the model of choice in `src/configs/{model_name}_base_config.yaml`, and run `cv_train_test.py`. 
	- this will print to stdout the MSE, R2, MAP, etc., metrics for the given configuration
	- additionally it will plot and save a resulting figure to `/results/base_results/figures`
